  <pre><b>2. Why I Made this project :-</b></pre>
  
  
  This project is to develop an application that will automate the whole procedure of a library. The software that would be developed should have facilities 
  like Add / Delete Members, Add / Delete Books, Issue & Return. The application should be secured, as well as with limited access. The main requirement of the project will 
  be the ease of use, besides being the most efficient and effective tool for the purpose. The application should be user friendly. It should be robust and scalable. An
   automated solution would be very beneficial to the organization, as it would bring structure to the whole process so that it can be traced for any kind of query. Also, 
   an automated solution will lead to optimal utilization of the available resources, reducing duplication of effort, increasing efficiency and minimizing time-delays. 
   Following are the main purpose of computerization:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>	To provide services to all the employees for issue, return & search etc. at one place.
</li>
<li>	To improve co-ordination in staff.
</li>
<li>	To reduce paper filling work.
</li>
<li>	To reduce risk of fraud.
</li>
<li>	To reduce chances of information leaking.
</li>
  </ul>

<p class="container" align="justify">A college library management is a project that manages and stores books information electronically according to studentâ€™s needs.
  The system helps both students and library manager to keep a constant track of all the books available in the library. It allows both the admin and the student to 
  search for the desired book. It becomes necessary for colleges to keep a continuous check on the books issued and returned and even calculate fine. This task if 
  carried out manually will be tedious and includes chances of mistakes. These errors are avoided by allowing the system to keep track of information such as issue date, 
  last date to return the book and even fine information and thus there is no need to keep manual track of this information which thereby avoids chances of mistakes.
Thus, this system reduces manual work to a great extent allows smooth flow of library activities by removing chances of errors in the details.
